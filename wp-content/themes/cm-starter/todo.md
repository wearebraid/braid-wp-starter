# CM Starter To Do

- site wide settings, such as how much padding between modules, etc.
- Custom shortcodes for use within wysiwygs
- Make sure WordPress is being backed up regularly
- Integrated Google Analytics in Site-Options. If code exists -- add the script in.
- Add default ACF Json file to import into install to have a good starting point -- which equates to the default modules
- Add default accessible tabs code to script.js -- either using data attributes or href/ids, etc.
- Set up infrastructure to add new buttons to the TinyMCE editor that maps into custom shortcodes that I create
